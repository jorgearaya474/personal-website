              Iâ€™m a web developer from Costa Rica ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡· with a passion for crafting
              intuitive and engaging websites. With over eight years of
              experience in the industry, Iâ€™ve had the chance to work on a wide
              range of projects â€” from custom WordPress builds to modern web
              apps using React, NextJS, and Laravel.

            <p className="text-white text-xl mb-3 text-justify">
              This diverse background has helped me develop a strong, adaptable
              skill set and a love for solving problems through clean,
              thoughtful code.

              I enjoy staying up to date with the latest technologies and
              trends, always looking for new things to learn and new challenges
              to tackle. Iâ€™m excited to keep growing and see where this journey
              takes me.
